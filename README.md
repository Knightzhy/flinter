flinter
====
This project is my common library.

It depends on another project called 'thirdparty', which contains necessary
thirdparty libraries that you can find on the public domain.

Put thirdparty and flinter side by side, build 'thirdparty' first, then
flinter can be built smoothly. If you'd like to build without thirdparty,
you need to install proper dependencies on your system.
